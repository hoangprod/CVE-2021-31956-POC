"# CVE-2021-31956" 

WIP PoC code for CVE-2021-31956 in preparation for OSEE. Will work on it after exam is over for stability and reliability.
A lot of offsets need to be hardcoded if it is different ( I doubt it) and you can't exit the program because many pool headers are still corrupted so if you exit it will bsod on free but it working for now. Will look into fixing it post OSEE.
